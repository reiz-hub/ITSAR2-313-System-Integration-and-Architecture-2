A microservices-based web application for managing students, courses, and enrollments. Built with **Node.js**, **Express**, **SQLite (sql.js)**, and **Vanilla JavaScript**.


## Architecture

This project was originally built as a monolith and later 
refactored into a microservices architecture. The system is 
split into three independent microservices plus an API gateway:

- **Student Service** – manages student data (port 3001)
- **Course Service** – manages course data (port 3002)
- **Enrollment Service** – manages enrollments (port 3003)
- **API Gateway** – single entry point that routes requests to the correct service (port 3000)

| Service            | Port | Database               | Description                        |
|--------------------|------|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| API Gateway        | 3000 | —                      | Reverse proxy + serves frontend    |
| Student Service    | 3001 | `students.sqlite`      | CRUD operations for students       |
| Course Service     | 3002 | `courses.sqlite`       | CRUD operations for courses        |
| Enrollment Service | 3003 | `enrollments.sqlite`   | Manages student-course enrollments |

- Each service runs independently on its own port with its own SQLite database.
- Services communicate exclusively via HTTP requests (no shared databases).
- Cascade deletion is handled through inter-service HTTP calls.
- All IDs use auto-increment integers for simplicity and performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/reiz-hub/ITSAR2-313-System-Integration-and-Architecture-2.git
cd Microservices
cd student-service && npm install && cd ..
cd course-service && npm install && cd ..
cd enrollment-service && npm install && cd ..
cd api-gateway && npm install && cd ..
```

### Starting All Services

Open **four separate terminals** and run one command in each:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Student Service
cd student-service && node server.js

# Terminal 2 — Course Service
cd course-service && node server.js

# Terminal 3 — Enrollment Service
cd enrollment-service && node server.js

# Terminal 4 — API Gateway
cd api-gateway && node server.js
```

Or from the root using npm scripts:

```bash
npm run start:student     # Terminal 1
npm run start:course      # Terminal 2
npm run start:enrollment  # Terminal 3
npm run start:gateway     # Terminal 4
```

The app will be available at **http://localhost:3000**.

### Seed Sample Data (Optional)

With all four services running:

```bash
node seed.js
```

This creates:
- **5 students** (Alice Johnson, Bob Smith, Carol Williams, David Brown, Eva Martinez)
- **5 courses** (Introduction to Programming, Data Structures, Web Development, Database Systems, Software Engineering)
- **12 enrollments** across students and courses

---


## Inter-Service Communication

- **Enrollment Service** calls Student and Course services via HTTP to validate data before creating enrollments. If a service is down it returns `503`; if it times out it returns `504`.
- **Student/Course Services** call Enrollment Service via HTTP to cascade-delete enrollments when a student or course is deleted. If the Enrollment Service is unavailable, the delete still succeeds with a `warning` field indicating orphan enrollments may remain.
- Each service can start, stop, and operate independently. If a dependency is down, the service degrades gracefully rather than crashing.


### Quick Test
```bash
# Test all endpoints
curl http://localhost:3000/students
curl http://localhost:3000/courses
curl http://localhost:3000/enrollments

# Test service health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

## Tech Stack

- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript (Fetch API)
- **Storage:** SQLite via sql.js (one database per service)
- **Communication:** HTTP REST (inter-service)
